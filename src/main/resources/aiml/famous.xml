        <template>Arturo Toscanini was an Italian conductor. Most musicians think he was the greatest conductor of his time. His fame was legendary: he was probably the first conductor to become a world superstar. He had an incredibly good memory and could remember every single note of the large number of works he conducted. He had a photographic memory so that he could remember what the pages looked like. Sometimes he found little mistakes in the scores which no one else had ever noticed. He had a very keen sense of hearing and knew exactly what each instrument was doing. He also had a fiery temperament and there are movies of him shouting angrily at his orchestra in rehearsals. In the early days of gramophone recordings he made some of the first recordings of famous orchestral works.</template>

        <pattern>WHO IS BACH</pattern>
        <template>Johann Sebastian Bach was a German composer and organist. He lived in the last part of the Baroque period. He never traveled very far, spending all his life in central Germany, but he studied all the music he could find by other composers of his time. His own music shows that he learned from the music of Italian, French and German composers. He spent several years working at courts of noblemen. Here he wrote most of his chamber music and orchestral music. Most of his life, however, he worked in a church where he was expected to write church music. Bach wrote almost every kind of music except opera. During the last part of his life most composers were writing in a new style called the Classical style, but Bach always wrote in the Baroque style. That made some people at the time think he was old-fashioned, but today we know that his work is the very best of Baroque music. Along with Mozart and Beethoven, Bach is regarded as one of the greatest composers who has ever lived.</template>

The main character, Borat, is a rude, stupid reporter who interviews famous people and ordinary people. The movie was very popular, but also seen as wrong and offensive by some people. This is because it was seen as anti-semitic and racist. Sacha Baron Cohen says this is wrong and he is Jewish himself. The movie received negative reactions of Kazakh people and the government, whereas the latter banned actor Sacha Baron Cohen from entering to Kazakhstan for his lifetime.</template>

        <template>Edward Benjamin Britten, Baron Britten of Aldeburgh, OM CH was probably the greatest English composer of his time. He came from East Anglia and he often thought about the East Anglian landscape and the sea when writing his music. He wrote a lot of music for his long-term partner, the tenor Peter Pears. His operas include Peter Grimes, Billy Budd, A Midsummer Night’s Dream, and Death in Venice. His War Requiem was performed in Coventry Cathedral in 1962 after it had been rebuilt because the old cathedral had been destroyed in the war. He wrote music for children which sounds like proper, adult music. Britten started the Aldeburgh Festival. He was an excellent pianist and conductor.</template>

        <pattern>WHO IS CLAUDE DEBUSSY</pattern>
        <template>Achille-Claude Debussy was a French composer. He was one of the most important composers of the early 20th century. Most of his compositions are for orchestra or for piano. He also wrote some songs, chamber music and one opera. He made his music very different from the Romantic style that other composers were using at the time. He is often called an Impressionistic composer because he was influenced by the group of painters called “Impressionists”. They were not so much interested in making their paintings look exactly like the real world, but preferred to paint things such as the effect of the sunlight shining on water. Debussy often did this in his music, which creates a special atmosphere.</template>

        <template>Charles Edward Ives was an American composer. He experimented with new ways of composing which many people did not understand at the time. These became more widely used later in the century. He used dissonant sounding intervals and techniques such as polytonality, polyrhythms and polytextures. Very few people listened to his music at the time he was writing it. Only much later did musicians start to realize the importance of his work. Ives earned his living as an insurance agent.

        <pattern>WHO IS DIANE KEATON</pattern>
        <template>Diane Keaton is an American movie actress, director, producer, and screenwriter.Keaton was born on January 5, 1946 in Los Angeles, California. Her mother, Dorothy Deanne, was a homemaker and amateur photographer; her father, John Newton Ignatius "Jack" Hall, was a real estate broker and civil engineer. Her father, from Nebraska, came from an Irish-American Catholic background, and her mother, originally from Kansas, came from a Methodist family, and had English, German, and more distant Austrian, ancestry. Keaton was raised a Free Methodist by her mother. Her mother won the "Mrs. Los Angeles" pageant for homemakers; Keaton has said that the theatricality of the event inspired her first impulse to be an actress, and led to her wanting to work on stage. She has also credited Katharine Hepburn, whom she admires for playing strong and independent women, as one of her inspirations.</template>

He was very successful both as a pianist and a composer. His Symphony No. 1 was very popular. His music sounded very modern with lots of dissonant chords.

This made Webster one of the most famous orators and powerful Whig leaders of the Second Party System. Webster did not like slavery, but he thought it was more important for the Union to stay together than anything else.</template>

        <template>Eddie Cantor was an American comedian, singer, actor, songwriter. Familiar to Broadway, radio and early television audiences, this "Apostle of Pep" was regarded almost as a family member by millions because his top-rated radio shows revealed intimate stories and amusing anecdotes about his wife Ida and five daughters. His eye-rolling song-and-dance routines eventually led to his nickname, Banjo Eyes, and in 1933, the artist Frederick J. Garner caricatured Cantor with large round and white eyes resembling the drum-like pot of a banjo. Cantor's eyes became his trademark, often exaggerated in illustrations, and leading to his appearance on Broadway in the musical Banjo Eyes. He was the original singer of 1929 hit song "Makin' Whoopie".</template>

        <template>Francisco Franco was a Spanish military leader who ruled as dictator of Spain from 1939 until his death.He was a leader of a coup d'état against the Spanish Second Republic in 1936. After this uprising the Spanish Civil War started. Franco was supported by fascists, big businesses, the church, conservative people and Spanish nationalists. This was because the Spanish Republic had a socialist government that wanted to make businesses and the church less powerful. The Republic also set up local parliaments in the regions of Spain. Spanish nationalists thought this was wrong and would make Spain weak. Franco remained neutral during World War II as Hitler did not accept his conditions for Spain to take part in it with the fascist and nazi regimes. He let a group of volunteer soldiers join the German Army to fight the Russians between 1941 and 1943. They were called the División Azul </template>

        <template>Franz Liszt was a Hungarian composer and pianist. Liszt was one of the most important musicians of the 19th century. He was the greatest pianist of his time and went on lots of tours through Europe where everyone filled the concert halls to hear him. He wrote a lot of music for piano. Many of his piano pieces were harder to play than anything that had been written before. In this way he developed the technique of piano playing, setting new standards for the future. In his compositions he often used new ideas which sounded very modern in his time. He was very helpful to other composers who lived at that time, helping them to become better known by conducting their works and playing some of their orchestral pieces on the piano.</template>

He was the World Chess Champion from 1985 to 2000. In 1993 he broke away from FIDE to make a rival organisation, because he felt FIDE had failed to raise enough money for world title matches. There is controversy about that period. By any measure, he is one of the greatest chess players of all time, and the highest-rated player before Magnus Carlsen.</template>

        <pattern>WHO IS GIUSEPPE VERDI</pattern>
        <template>Giuseppe Verdi was an Italian composer of operas. Verdi and Richard Wagner were the greatest composers of opera in the 19th century although they were completely different from one another. When Verdi was a young man the most famous opera composers in Italy were Gaetano Donizetti and Vincenzo Bellini who wrote in the bel canto tradition. This meant that their operas had beautiful tunes which were written for singers to show off their voices, even if what they sang did not suit the story. During his long life Verdi changed opera so that it did not have to obey old-fashioned rules. He made the drama the most important thing and the music is there to help the drama; that said, Verdi is most remembered for the power of his music.</template>

Their behaviour, attitude and look also tended to make people go crazy.</template>

        <pattern>WHO IS JOHANN SEBASTIAN BACH</pattern>
        <template>Johann Sebastian Bach was a German composer and organist. He lived in the last part of the Baroque period. He never traveled very far, spending all his life in central Germany, but he studied all the music he could find by other composers of his time. His own music shows that he learned from the music of Italian, French and German composers. He spent several years working at courts of noblemen. Here he wrote most of his chamber music and orchestral music. Most of his life, however, he worked in a church where he was expected to write church music. Bach wrote almost every kind of music except opera. During the last part of his life most composers were writing in a new style called the Classical style, but Bach always wrote in the Baroque style. That made some people at the time think he was old-fashioned, but today we know that his work is the very best of Baroque music. Along with Mozart and Beethoven, Bach is regarded as one of the greatest composers who has ever lived.</template>

He is one of the most famous people from Finland and one of the greatest composers of symphonies of all times. He was born at a time when Russia had a lot of power in Finland and the Finnish people were trying hard to keep their own culture and their independence. This nationalism can be heard in a lot of his music, especially some of the choral music. After 1928 he composed very little. He lived in retirement in his home in the Finnish countryside.</template>

He was the son of Kim Il-Sŏng. Official North Korean propaganda said that Jong-il was born on Mount Paektu ; but most historians think that he was born near Chabarowsk in the Soviet Union. Inside North Korea, it was the law that no one could try to replace Jong-il as leader of the country. He was sometimes referred to as the "Dear Leader", but this was not an official title. His official title was "Chairman of the National Defense Commission of North Korea", "Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army" and "General Secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea". Many people in North Korea were imprisoned or killed for speaking out against the Kim regime.

These included The Birth of a Nation, Intolerance, Broken Blossoms, Way Down East, and Orphans of the Storm. One of the famous images of Gish's silent movie years is the climax of Way Down East. Her character floats unconscious on an ice floe towards a waterfall, her long hair floating in the water. She made "talkies", too. Her sound movie work was off and on. She was in the controversial western Duel in the Sun and Night of the Hunter. She did a lot of television work from the early 1950s until the 1980s. At the end of her career she appeared with Bette Davis in the 1987 movie The Whales of August. She never married or had children. She died in her sleep of natural causes on February 27, 1993. She is buried next to her sister Dorothy at Saint Bartholomew's Episcopal Church in New York City. Gish's career lasted 75 years, from 1912 to 1987. She was given the nickname "The First Lady of American Cinema". The American Film Institute named Gish 17th among the greatest female stars of all time. She received an Honorary Academy Award in 1971. In 1984 she received an AFI Life Achievement Award.</template>

It was a method of education which respected the natural development of the child. Its main feature was to allow as much independence as possible to the individual child. Another feature was to allow mixed ages in the same classroom. This was different from the formal classroom teaching used even for young children at the time. Maria Montessori started this method when she was in charge of a school for handicapped children. Maria Montessori also founded around 1907 in San Lorenzo, a slum area of Rome, the first Casa dei Bambini. She died on May 6, 1952.</template>

        <template>Modest Petrovitch Mussorgsky was a Russian composer.Mussorgsky is famous for his operas and songs. He discovered new ways of writing for the voice which were very tuneful but which also suited the Russian language. His most famous opera is Boris Godunov. He wrote an overture called Night on a Bare Mountain. Another very famous piece is called Pictures at an Exhibition. He wrote it for the piano, but many years after his death another composer called Maurice Ravel orchestrated it and this is the version people usually hear today. Some of his works were re-orchestrated and "improved" by the composer Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov. In recent years people have started to think that what Mussorgsky wrote originally was better.</template>

        <template>Maurice Ravel was a French composer. His name is often thought of together with that of Claude Debussy, but their music is really very different. Ravel liked children and animals and his music is often about them. He liked to write about fairy tales and stories from far away lands. He wrote some lovely piano music, most of which is difficult to play. Boléro is a 17 minute piece for orchestra. A short version was used by ice-skaters Torvill and Dean for the dance that made them Olympic champions in 1984.</template>

Her parents had moved from Belarus to protect themselves from the Chernobyl nuclear accident.

She would practice tennis by hitting the tennis ball against the wall every day, and her dad soon noticed that she was very good at the sport. Maria's tennis coaches told the Sharapovs that they should move to Moscow, Russia, to get better training.

        <template>Michel de Nostredame, also known as Nostradamus, was a French apothecary and allegedly a doctor. He was born in Provence. He is famous as a 'seer' who wrote collections of prophecies that have since become famous around the world. His best known book was called Les Propheties and first appeared in 1555. Since its first publication the book has rarely been out of print. Over the years, many people have come to believe that Nostradamus predicted a range of events in history. People often reached this conclusion by applying methods similar to the Bible code - i.e. by twisting the texts in such a way as to suggest that they predicted the future. He died of edema in Provence.</template>

        <template>Phyllis Schlafly was an American conservative. She was a political activist, author, and constutional attorney.Her best-selling book, A Choice, Not an Echo, was written in 1964. The book was about corruption in the Republican Party and how people with lot of money unfairly influenced elections. She was a big supporter of Barry Goldwater, who was the Republican Party's nominee for president in 1964. Goldwater had beaten Nelson Rockefeller, a more moderate candidate backed by big money. Although Goldwater would lose the 1964 election to Lyndon Johnson, the campaign helped start the modern conservative movement. Starting in 1967, she published her own newspaper, the Phyllis Schlafly Report. When the Equal Rights Amendment was passed by congress, she organized a campaign against it. Schlafly argued that the amendment would not actually help women, often pointing out that it would force women to be drafted. After a long and controversial debate, the amendment was not added to the Constitution. Schlafly is usually considered the main force that stopped it. She is very critical of the feminist movement, saying that "it teaches women to be victims." She helped with Ronald Reagan's campaign for the presidency in 1980. Schlafly remained active in politics until her death. She died at the age of 92.</template>

He first became widely known in the 1990s when he appeared in a wide variety of television programs, films, and musical albums. He was once a fixture on the Atlanta and New York City gay club scenes during the 1980s and early 90s. RuPaul has on occasion performed as a man in a number of roles. He is usually billed as RuPaul Charles. RuPaul is noted among famous drag queens for his indifference towards the gender-specific pronouns used to address him—both "he" and "she" have been deemed acceptable. "You can call me he. You can call me she. You can call me Regis and Kathie Lee; I don't care! Just as long as you call me." He hosted a short-running talk show on VH1. He has hosted reality television shows called RuPaul's Drag Race and RuPaul's Drag U.</template>

He first appeared in Amazing Fantasy #15 in August 1962. The premise was that he was an orphan being raised by his Aunt May and Uncle Ben as an ordinary teenager. He would deal with the normal struggles of being young as well as the struggles of being of a costumed crime fighter. His powers were super strength, agility, the ability to cling to almost every surface, the ability to shoot spider-webs using an device that he invented which he calls "web-shooters," and reacting to danger quickly with his "spider-sense", enabling him to combat many foes similar to that of a spider.</template>

He also wrote the band's first album, Piper at the Gates of Dawn. After this record came out, he used a lot of psychedelic drugs. He was forced out of the band in 1968. He made two more records after he left the band, but they were not popular because the lyrics were very unusual, and because the music did not always have a steady beat. He later ended up with mental health problems, possibly because of all the drugs he took. Some of his most famous solo songs are "Dark Globe", "Octopus" and "Vegetable Man".</template>

        <template>Thomas Jonathan Jackson was an Educator and he was leading Confederate general of the American Civil War. He earned the name "Stonewall" after the First Battle of Bull Run. He was frequently called the most brilliant strategist in the Confederate Army. Jackson was considered Robert E. Lee's "right hand". Jackson was mortally wounded at the Battle of Chancellorsville. On May 2, 1863, he was scouting ahead of his lines when one of his own men mistakenly shot him. His left arm was badly wounded requiring the doctors to amputate it two inches below his shoulder. He died on May 10, 1863, at the age of 39. It is probable he died of a pulmonary embolism and not from pneumonia.</template>

        <template>"Trigger" Willie Hugh Nelson is an American country music singer-songwriter, as well as an author, poet, actor, and activist.Willie Nelson was born in Abbott, Texas on April 29, 1933, during the Great Depression to Myrle Marie and Ira Doyle Nelson. He was born on April 29, 1933, but his birth was recorded by doctor F. D. Sims on April 30. He was named Willie by his cousin Mildred, who also chose Hugh as his middle name, in honor of her recently deceased younger brother. Nelson's ancestry includes English, Irish, and Cherokee. His parents moved from Arkansas in 1929, to look for work. Nelson's grandfather, William, worked as a blacksmith, while his father worked as a mechanic. His mother left soon after he was born, and his father remarried and also moved away, leaving Willie and his sister Bobbie to be raised by their grandparents. The Nelsons, who taught singing back in Arkansas, started their grandchildren in music. Nelson's grandfather bought him a guitar when he was six, and taught him a few chords, and with his sister Bobbie, he sang gospel songs in the local church. He wrote his first song at age seven, and when he was nine, played guitar for the local band Bohemian Polka. During the summer, the family picked cotton along with other citizens of Abbott. Nelson didn't like picking cotton, so he earned money by singing in dance halls, taverns, and honky tonks from age thirteen, and continuing through high school. Nelson's musical influences were Hank Williams, Bob Wills, Lefty Frizzell, Ray Price, Ernest Tubb, Hank Snow, Django Reinhardt, Frank Sinatra and Louis Armstrong.</template>
